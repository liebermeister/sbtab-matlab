Matlab code for SBtab file format
=================================

[SBtab](https://www.sbtab.net) is a table-based data format for Systems Biology, designed to support automated data integration and model building. It uses the structure of spreadsheets and defines conventions for table structure, controlled vocabularies and semantic annotations. The format comes with predefined table types for experimental data and SBML-compliant model structures and can easily be customized to cover new types of data.
